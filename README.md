# Benny Lang

[![Build](https://github.com/https123456789/benny_lang/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/https123456789/benny_lang/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A compiled language with an interesting syntax.

## Why

I started this project for two main reasons:

1. I wanted to learn more about compilers, assembly, and binaries.
2. I was on winter break and wanted a project to work on.

## Language Specifications

The specifications for the language can be found in the `docs/lang_specs` folder. The README file inside that folder will tell you what order they are meant to be read in.

## Codebase Style

Commits in the codebase follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style.
